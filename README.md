# Balochi Labz Balad

Balochi Labz Balad is the first-ever Android Balochi dictionary app, initially released on August 25, 2017. The project was later abandoned and removed from the Play Store due to inactivity. As the original developers have not responded to communication attempts, I have reverse-engineered the APK and retrieved the source code, making it available as an open-source project.

This dictionary app contains 15,000 Balochi words, offering a simple yet powerful user interface. The app includes features such as efficient and intelligent search, favorites, and search history tracking.

## Project Status
This project is currently being revived and is open for contributions. The source code may have bugs and lacks some features, so community contributions are encouraged to improve and update the app.

## Original APK
For reference, the original APK can be downloaded from:
